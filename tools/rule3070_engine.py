"""tools/rule3070_engine.py — the 30-70 Rule on NSE stocks, in rupees.

A port of the CryptoForge engine (tools/rule3070_sim.py there) with the three
things an Indian stock does differently from a coin:

  * WHOLE SHARES. A coin takes any notional down to $5.5; NSE sells one share
    or none. A slice worth less than a share is not a small buy — it is one
    share, and on a Rs 2,000 share that is the smallest bet the account can
    place. LOT_SIZE controls this (1 for cash equity).
  * SESSION BARS, NOT A CONTINUOUS TAPE. The series jumps 09:15 to 09:15 with
    no overnight or weekend bars. Nothing here assumes evenly spaced bars, but
    every "hold time" is calendar time, so a 3-day hold is 3 trading days of
    bars spread over a real week.
  * GAPS FILL AT THE GAP, IN THE MARKET'S FAVOUR. The entry is a buy-STOP
    above the market, so a session that opens ABOVE it buys at the open —
    worse than the line. The target is a limit sell, so a session that opens
    above IT sells at the open — better than the line. Both are what the
    opening cross actually does to those orders, and on NSE the open is a gap
    most mornings. GAP_FILLS=False reproduces the crypto engine's
    fill-exactly-at-the-line behaviour instead.

Phil's spec, as adjudicated across 2026-08-10 (eighth pass — corrected against
his TradingView screenshot of BTCUSDT 5m, 2026-08-07):

- MOTHER = the standing structure top, same law as his trendlines: the
  high-water mark (wick counts) since the last candle that CLOSED above it.
- The V is the small structure RIGHT AFTER the mother candle, not the deep
  bottom: price dips to a SWING LOW, bounces to a SWING HIGH (a lower top on
  a failed V, above the mother on an extra V, level on an equal V). That
  little V is the buyer involvement, and the fibs are drawn from it at once.
- Two fibs share the swing-low anchor, levels 0/1/2/4 only, projected down
  (level n = high - n x leg):
    Fib-S: swing low -> swing high
    Fib-B: swing low -> mother high
  REFERENCE = the upper of the two level-2s. NO size gate of any kind —
  "no small or large; the percent of fall is the one we are working here."
- First touch of the reference starts the measurement; a candle CLOSE below
  it arms the 30% buy.
- Entry: low + 0.25 x (mother - low) — a quarter of the whole fall back up,
  trailing every new low until it fills, never cancelled.
- The ladder: buys alternate 30, 70, 30, 70… downward. Every 30% buy
  re-anchors Fib-S's level 1 to its low (its level 2 = next 30% boundary);
  every 70% buy re-anchors Fib-B's level 1 to its low (its level 2 = next
  70% boundary). Band 1's 70% arms when the low from before the 30% breaks.
  Each buy must fill below the previous fill.
- TARGET = average buy + 0.25 x (mother - lowest low). Never below the
  average buy; deeper ladders earn a bigger target. One target closes all.
- CANCEL: a candle close above max(mother, swing high) before the first fill
  kills the setup (falling-market trade only). After a fill the target is
  always crossed first.
- MONEY: pot = fall% from mother x capital/100 measured at each fill
  (deepens with the fall, cascade-style), split 30/70, every order rounded
  DOWN to whole shares with one share as the floor.
- SEQUENTIAL: when a campaign ends and the mother still stands, scanning
  resumes immediately — the next dip-and-bounce V under the same mother
  starts the next trade. A new wick top becomes the mother for future Vs
  without killing a running campaign (only its own close-above rule can).

Known conventions still awaiting Phil's confirmation: 5-bar swing pivots;
close-above (not wick) as the break; the intrabar rule that a bar both
making the low and reaching the entry must CLOSE through it to fill.
